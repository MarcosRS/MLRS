    <p>Hello there,</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m Marcos Reynoso and I am a Software Engineer. Everything started when I was in college (computer science) in Dominican Republic. I was taking your normal programming classes and I noticed I really enjoyed programming. It is like having the world at your finger tips. Before that, I was into computer networking since high school and even had a job as an IT.</p>
    <p>When I was working in IT and taking my college classes I was also becoming more serious about programming and in addition to that I started picking up languages like PHP, C#, Javascript and, Java.</p>
    <p>After college I decided to go back to New York and start working as a web developer and got a job as a Front-End developer. That is when I really started picking up a bunch of things up really fast, like for example good practices in areas like JavaScript and CSS and even how to use some common tools correctly. I have to say there is nothing like having a good team and being a good team member when it comes to programming and I bet other areas too.</p>
    <p>Then like any person that really likes what they are doing, I started to want to get even better and learn more. I decided I wanted to become a Fullstack developer and learn the tip of the spear technology in software development. So I started researching and found Fullstack Academy which has one of the most advanced  programs for software engineering in the US and gave it a shot.</p>
    <p>I had no problem in completing the program due to my previous experience and now I am looking for a position where I can have access to develop in both worlds, front and back end development in an awesome office culture.</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading</p>
